			<p>Jue&#39;s career has spanned pivotal roles in <a>private equity</a> and <a>manufacturing</a>, further enriched by MBA internships at BCG and Tishman Speyer, yet the common thread has been his commitment to empowering leaders to achieve ambitious goals and make a tangible difference in the lives of many.</p>

			<p>Currently a <a>Columbia Business School MBA candidate</a>, Jue has developed a burgeoning interest in coding and has been working on practical applications, such as using statsmodels and scikit-learn to predict whether TikTok videos presented claims or opinions. Jue earned a Bachelor's degree in Finance from <a>Case Western Reserve University</a>.</p>
